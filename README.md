# Ray-tracing
Ray-tracing algorithm parallelised.

Compiling:
make to create the sequential executable program.
make clean to remove the image.ppm and the program.

Files:
- ray-tracing: sequential algorithm.
- ray-tracing-cpu: algorithm parallelised with openmp and mpi.
- ray-tracing-gpu: algorithm parallelised with cuda.

Instructions:
Follow the steps given by the program for generating the 3 dimension space or use 
the files test1 and test 2 executing with: ./ray-tracing <test1/test2>.

All the distances are given in meters (for example: 3.2 means 3.2m).
